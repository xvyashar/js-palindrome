# Palindrome Math Challenge
It's a simple & fun math challenge. This small JS script will take a number from input, then add its reversed to it and will repeat this step till gets a palindrome as result (a number that is same with its reversed version. like: 1771)
> example: `568(input)` + `865(reversed input)` = `1271` --> `1271` + `1721` = `2992(palindrome)`

## How to Use
- clone: `git clone https://github.com/xvyashar/js-palindrome.git`
- install dependencies: `npm install`
- run: `node index.js <input_number>`

## Fun Fact:
If you test some special numbers like `196` & `295` as input, you'll never reach to palindrome :)
